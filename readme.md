# docker compositions

ready to go docker compose configurations; not intended to be used in production environments.

## why docker hub isn't used

because i'm getting 403 from docker hub due to sanctions; guess all iranians are being associated with IRGC for no reason! so fuck you docker org.

## elastic stack

[this](https://www.elastic.co/blog/getting-started-with-the-elastic-stack-and-docker-compose) guide was used; couldn't set up filebeat because there was breaking changes. [this](https://github.com/elkninja/elastic-stack-docker-part-one/issues/31) didn't work with 8.17.4.
